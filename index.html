               <h1>What Can I Do?</h1>
               <p>
                   I'm the kind of person who thrives with new challenges and room to grow and help others.  A recently
                   taken personality quiz stated that I have many interests&#44 and therefore am likely to have a variety of
                   talents.  My past roles include &#40but are not limited to&#41&#58 barista&#44 flight attendant&#44 
                   travel agent&#44 promotional model&#44 bartender&#44 and General Manager.  Each role came with a whole
                   new set of challenges and skill sets.  These have led me to learn Excel&#44 Microsoft Office&#44 and 
                   a variety of POS systems like Aloha and Square.  Past coworkers and employers would say that I am 
                   proficient in leadership&#44 teamwork&#44 communication&#44 adaptability&#44 and I have a strong work 
                   ethic.

               <h1>What Am I Up To?</h1>
               <p>
                   Currently enrolled in LaunchCode's CoderGirl program on the Java track, I'm learning to code!  I'm not
                   yet halfway through the program but I am able to say that I can solve simple technical questions in 
                   Javascript and am able to start on some passion projects.  Networking within the tech community has been
                   a breath of fresh air as I find it to be extremely welcoming and open.  This program is making what I 
                   thought to be a possibly difficult career transition into a very fulfilling one.  Codergirl has brought
                   out some problem solving skills I didn't know I had in me, as well as helped me develop my organization 
                   and time management.

               <h1>The 2020 Vision</h1>
               <p>
                   The original goal was to get out of the hamster wheel of all I knew in the workforce and make the full leap
                   into a technical career that would grant me the freedom and satisfaction of a job well done.  This has
                   developed into the realization that this opportunity will open even more doors.  By this time next year, I
                   see myself in a full time Java developer position at a company that I love and appreciate and I plan to
                   have launched my own blog with an adjoining app and coaching practice. The possiblities are endless!
